### Load file to r as dataframe
```{r}
df1 <- read.csv('~/Documents/Principle of DS/Project/datasets/student-mat.csv') # Change this according to the file name and directory of the file.
```



### Explore the dataset
```{r}
print(dim(df1)) # Check the dimension of the dataset

# glimpse is better than str(). More organised, easy to read. 
# Also dim f(x) is baked into the glimpse.
print(glimpse(df1)) # from tidyverse
View(df1) # view the dataset in a different window

# Not best practice to use attach()
# attach(df1) # Basically next time we need to get a column inside a f(x) we don't need to call df$column

# Explore the column names
names(df1)

# Before checking for missing values, list all unique values in the dataframe. Look for "" cells
unique(unlist(df1))
```
There are no empty cells to impute. Example: "" to NA

```{r}
# Check for missing data in df1
print(colSums(is.na(df1)))
```
No NA values. 

```{r}
# Before we change the datatypes we must check the unique values in each column.
# Start!. Adding Start for easier readability.
lapply(df1, unique)
```


### Change the datatype of each accordingly 
```{r}
# List columns that should be factor (not ordered)
col_factors <- c('school', 'sex', 'address','Pstatus','Mjob','Fjob','reason','guardian')
df1[col_factors] <- lapply(df1[col_factors], factor)

# List columns that should be factor (ordered)
col_factorsO <- c('famsize')
df1[col_factorsO] <- lapply(df1[col_factorsO], ordered, levels = c('LE3','GT3'))

# List columns that should be binary
col_binary <- c('schoolsup','famsup','paid','activities','nursery','higher','internet','romantic')

```
